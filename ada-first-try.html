            <p>What we want to build?</p>
            <p>We want to built up a community based on life-long learning and continual education. We think that we, as individuals, we need to grow and expend our knowledge and domains of expertise continually.</p>

                <p>Education in its general sense is a form of learning in which the knowledge, skills, and habits of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through teaching, training, or research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of others, but may also be autodidactic.[1] Any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. Education is commonly divided into stages such as preschool, primary school, secondary school and then college, university or apprenticeship.</p>
