            <h4><b>The Vision Behind TechKids</b></h4>
            <p> The ambition of this project is to help Kenya's most forgotten kids to become
                a generation of tech kids.</br></br>
                Our objective is to encourage these children develop a different set of skills,
                by offering them access to technology and information and teaching them how to
                use them.</br></br>
                We believe that by empowering them to handle modern technologies,
                we create opportunities for their future, which otherwise would be impossible.
                We believe knowledge will be the trigger for transforming their communities for
                the better and getting them out of poverty.</br></br></p>

            <h4><b>TechKids First Edition</b></h4>
            <p>Kenya’s TechKids starts as a 2 weeks pilot programme, aiming to expose
                children to computational thinking and information technology.</br></br>
                20 children will learn how to use a laptop and will get familiarised
                with basic programming concepts, by using fun and specially designed
                learning software for kids. Using this software, they will learn a wide
                range of things, from creating animations to making music and designing
                simple interactive games.</br></br>

                The teaching techniques used are based on
                    intuitive learning --
                        encouraging children to discover concepts on their own,
                        come up with initiative and build the projects they choose.

                They are meant to stimulate
                children’s problem solving aptitudes, as well as logical thinking and creativity.</br></br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8 strip-description">
            <h4><b>Long-term Vision</b></h4>
            <p>The goal is to extend the 2 weeks programme to a long-term course,
                where children expand their knowledge, share it with others and
                become confident on their skills.</br></br>
                If the pilot project will prove successful, we intend to follow up
                by establishing collaborations with local volunteers from Kenya,
                who will continue the teaching. We plan to offer them trainings and
                support in order to help them become self-sustaining.</br></br></p>

           <!--M: Can you make resources cleareR?-->

            <p>We are a group of young people who feel we had the privilege to grow
                into what we are today by benefiting from access to education and
                resources. We are eager to give forward this privilege and to share
                our resources with others.</p><br/>

           <p>
                We have different backgrounds, some are students, IT experts, educators,
                but what we have in common is our vision to share with others through
                education.</p><br/>

           <p>
                Some of us have been to Kenya before and
                were impressed by children there.

                We admired especially their eagerness to learn, their
                seriousness in the class, and their appreciation for small things.</p><br/>

                <p> <b>Support a volunteer.</b> A great deal of our expenses will be covered by ourselves. Some of us will

                    <b>Offer a Laptop</b>. The main financial support needed is for purchasing the laptops
                    used for the courses. We want to provide at least one laptop for two students,
                    which means a minimum of 10 laptops.</br></br>

                    <b>Donate Teaching Materials. </b> Other expenses will cover costs with materials used as learning support
                    and for recreational activities.</br></br>
